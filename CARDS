"maybe retry" means "retry if the child has been spawned < 5 times"

Program should:
2- catch sigchld
	- check exit code:
		- 0? exit with success
		- !0? record result and maybe retry
3- look at child process thread state & user/system time
	- inspect /proc/$PID/task/*/stat
	- fields (thread ID is directory name) STATE, UTIME, STIME
	- if thread list is different from before, reset the hung counter
	- if any thread is not in "S" state, reset the HC
	- if UTIME or STIME has increased by > 1 in any thread, reset HC
	- memorize current UTIME and STIME for all threads, increment HC
	- if HC >= 5, kill child, record result, maybe retry
